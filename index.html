  <h2>#1 SPORTS <br>
  🎾 🏐 ⚽️ 🏓 ⛷ 🏂 🏄🏽‍♂️</h2>
  <p>I am generally up for any <strong>ball sports</strong> except of basketball. I know... weird for a 6.5 feet guy, but I just can't throw a ball with two hands.
  So, I prefer tennis, beachvolleyball, table tennis, badminton and soccer as ball sports. <br> <br>
  As <strong>winter sports</strong>and because I am Austrian of course I do some skiing snowboarding and ice skating.
  I also love any <strong>nature sports</strong> like hiking, climbing, kayaking or just running in the forest. <br> <br>In Barcelona I would love to do surfing but still waiting for the waves... 💁🏼‍♂️

  <h2>#2 MUSIC 🎸</h2>
  <p>As my mum forced our family to sing in front of all our neighbors doors during pre-Christmas time when I was younger I guess she sparked some passion for music.
    I play guitar since I am 10 and have played in several bands since then. I especially enjoy playing fun and
    motivating acoustic covers in front of a dancing crowd. <br><br> I also like going to any concerts where people actually play instruments! So hit me up if you know some real bands playing in town. ;)

  <h2>#3 TRAVEL</h2>
  <p> Lucky to be able to afford travelling I have used pretty much every opportunity during my school and study time to do so. I did two exchange semesters in Boston and Buenos Aires and have been to every continent already. My absolute favorite though is South America <3
    Lately, I stopped travelling in high speed and enjoy staying at nice places like Barcelona as long as possible to actually inhale the vibes.

  <h2>#4 EATING CHOCOLOATE</h2>

<p> My biggest weakness. If you really want to make me happy, give me chocolate (BTW great answer if a company asks you for your biggest weakness).
